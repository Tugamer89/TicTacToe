# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a C++ implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player plays against an AI. The game uses a 2D matrix to represent the board and players can input their desired position to place their symbol (O or X). The game constantly checks for a winning player or a tie and displays the final result. The code also includes a function to generate a random move for the AI at the start of the game.
